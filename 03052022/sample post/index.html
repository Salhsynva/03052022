                    <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single
                        sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions
                        eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal
                        earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly
                        round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

                    <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no
                        turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from
                        science.

                    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that
                        they set eye on the earth.

                    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become
                        her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time.
                        I could not help but love and cherish her.

                    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who
                        will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our
                        world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for 'aiming for the stars.' Both figuratively and literally,
                        it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is
                        always the thrill of just beginning.

                    <p class="p-clr">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not
                        yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next
                        ten.

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is
                        a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
                        development.

                        As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the
                        size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked
                        so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.
                        Seeing this has to change a man.

                        mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go
                        where no man has gone before.
